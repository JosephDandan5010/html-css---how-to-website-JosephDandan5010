    <h1 class="text-center">Finding Diamonds in Minecraft</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-center">Step 1. Get the right tools!</h2><img class="m-auto col-3 d-block" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/d/d1/Iron_Pickaxe_JE3_BE2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/150?cb=20200105053011">
        <p class="text-center"> To find and mine some sweet sweet diamonds you need to first gather the proper tools.
            A simple wood, stone, or gold pickaxe won't do though you will need an iron pickaxe to
            mine it with. Once you have the correct pickaxe in hand, a plethora of torches, a trusty weapon, and
            some durable armor you are ready to start mining for diamonds! But wait how are you going to even find them?
        </p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-center">Step 2. Know where to mine!</h2><img class="m-auto col-7 d-block" src="https://i.redd.it/czzlfyo6q0531.png">
        <p class="text-center"> Diamond Ore only spawns in layers y 1-16, but is most abundantly on y 11-12.
            To check what y level you are on hit f3. Diamonds can spawn in veins as large as 8 blocks and as small
            as 1 block. There are some dangers in searching for diamonds mobs, gravel suffication, and most frequently
            lava. Lava appears most frequent on y 4-10 so to stay a bit safer and make sure your diamonds don't get
            burnt to a crisp try to stay above those layers.

        <h2 class="text-center">Step 3. Exploring Caves!</h2><img class="m-auto col-7 d-block" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFqSa6uL-oI/maxresdefault.jpg">
        <p class="text-center"> An effective fun method of finding diamonds is exploring cave systems which can sometimes
            be massive. Diamond Ore can also be pretty easy to spot in those massive cave systems and if its across lava
            just carry your trusty water bucket to get across.

        <h2 class="text-center">Step 4. Mining Methods!</h2>
        <h4 class="text-center"> There are multiple and effective methods in the art of finding diamonds.</h4>
            <h6 class="text-center">The Staircase Mining Method</h6> <img class="m-auto col-7 d-block" src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/minecraft/7/72/Staircase.jpg?width=960">  
            <p> Since you should never mine straight down in minecraft the stair case
            method is a great way of exploring the depths of the world safely while finding a lot of ores along the way.</p>
            <h6 class="text-center">The Branch Mining Method</h6> <img class="m-auto col-7 d-block" src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/minecraft/e/ef/Branchmining.jpg?width=960">
            <p> A very effective way to find diamonds is to branch mine by making a
            2x2 tunnel or more and digging individual branches by however so many blocks. This method covers a lot of ground quickly
            without having to break any uneccessary blocks.</p>
            <h6 class="text-center">The Strip Mining Method</h6> <img class="m-auto col-7 d-block" src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/minecraft/5/57/Stripmining.jpg?width=960"> 
            <p>Strip mining is a lot less fun then it sounds. It involves mining everything
            in hopes of receiving a rare ore. You can either strip mine in a singular 1x1 line or you can expand from a box shaped area.
            Both are time consuming, but you will get a ton of building blocks, resources, and a cool space to build in!

        <h2 class="text-center">Other Tips!</h2><img class="m-auto col-3 d-block" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r4D7ZEMRtfiCMUTPHcCReXnwNaj_OZ6koqq7nYqFOGB4iW0IpEepYSroEjWTQqIGLHfBRWYDF8KXfhVhiodQyg">
        <p class="text-center">Other methods of obtaining diamonds are less common for example chests in abandoned
            mineshafts, villages, dungeons, temples, strongholds, nether fortress's, and end cities all have a chance
            for a diamond in it, but don't rely on chests in your pursuit of diamonds. Don't get too excited make sure
            there isn't any lava underneath to turn those diamonds to dust. Bring a lot of torches unless you want to say
            "Awww Man".

        <h2 class="text-center">Summary</h2>
        <p class="text-center">These methods/tips are useful and are used by a vast majority of the game's playerbase, but 
            if you don't like any of these methods you could always come up with your own to find some of that blue stuff.
